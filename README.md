# Regression Models
This repository contains the final assignments for the Regression Models course at Carlos III University of Madrid (UC3M).

The aim of this project is to develope accurate price prediction models for residential homes in Ames, Iowa, utilizing regression modeling techniques.

## Modelling Competition: House Prices
The characteristics of a house strongly influence its sale price. While certain features such as size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the presence of a garage are known to impact prices, there are other factors that are not as readily apparent. These include the condition of the house, its location, and even the preferences of potential buyers.

## Aim
1.	Create an effective price prediction model.
2.	Identify the important home price attributes.
3.	Validate the model’s prediction accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises comprehensive information about nearly 3000 residential homes in Ames, Iowa, including their various attributes and corresponding sale prices. Analyzing this dataset provides insights into the factors influencing house prices and enables the construction of predictive models to estimate property values.
The data used in this project was provided by the professor.
